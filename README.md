## E-commerce demo with Gatsby.js
A demo for an online plant shop built from the Gatsby `hello-world` boilerplate.

The product inventory comes from [Aamu.app](Aamu.app) via GraphQL.

The original author is [https://github.com/nhuynh1](Nancy), who we want to thank a lot. We at Aamu.app added the GraphQL integration.

## Requirements

- An account at [Aamu.app](Aamu.app).
- A *database* at Aamu.app and an API key to this database.
- A [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) account and a secret key (testing key is OK).

## Live demo hosted on Netlify
