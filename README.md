## E-commerce demo with Gatsby.js
A demo for an online plant shop built from the Gatsby `hello-world` boilerplate.

The product inventory comes from [Aamu.app](Aamu.app) via GraphQL.

The original author is [https://github.com/nhuynh1](Nancy), who we want to thank a lot. We at Aamu.app added the GraphQL integration.

## Requirements

- An account at [Aamu.app](Aamu.app).
- A *database* at Aamu.app and an API key to this database.
- A [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) account and a secret API key (Dashboard/Developers/API keys) (testing key is OK).

## Installation

- Click "Deploy to Netlify" (see below).
- Click "Connect to GitHub".
- Insert your secret keys (Aamu.app + Stripe).
- After Netlify is done building, go to your repository at GitHub and edit the file `config-client.js` and insert your Stripe *public key*, commit the file.
- After Netlify is done building again, everything should work. If not, go through every step to make sure everything was done correctly.
